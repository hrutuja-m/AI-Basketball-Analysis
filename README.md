# AI-Basketball-Analysis
üèÄ Analyze basketball shots and shooting pose with machine learning!
This is an artificial intelligence application built on the concept of object detection. Analyze basketball shots by digging into the data collected from object detection. We can get the result by simply uploading files to the web App, or submitting a POST request to the API.
All the data for the shooting pose analysis is calculated by implementing OpenPose. Please note that this is an implementation only for noncommercial research use only. Please read the LICENSE, which is exactly the same as the CMU's OpenPose License.
Shot detection
Detection will be shown on the image. The confidence and the coordinate of the detection will be listed below.
Detecting and tracking moving objects are key tasks for an AI in order to succeed in and thrive in this niche. Sports is equivalent to motion, people and objects moving in different speeds and directions.
